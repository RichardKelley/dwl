  <description>The Dynamic Whole Body Locomotion library (DWL) implements a set of
    functionalities to develop, design, and deploy locomotion algorithms, i.e. planning,
    control, etc. DWL has different modules such as: kinematics, dynamics, solvers
    (tree-search, optimization, etc), and environment descriptions. All these tools
    are designed for many different locomotion problems such as planning, control
    and state estimation. DWL library is developed to be able to deploy in different
    robot framework systems such as ROS, and test it in real-time kernels. DWL has
    different library dependencies, which most of them are optional. DWL is develop
    by Carlos Mastalli (carlos.mastalli@iit.it) at Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia.

    As well as DWL source code, we provide implementation of different dwl-based
    locomotion modules such: control, planning and perception. All these modules
    use ROS as framework for communication between them. As standard message
    interface between them, we use dwl_msgs packages and a set of commons methods
    used in the controllers and planners.
